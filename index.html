		<h4>This week's focus: Brexit</h4>
        <p>One very recent event in face of the world was UK’s exit from the European Union. The event had manifold implications such as social, economical etc. Coincidentally enough, it happened a day before birthday of the greatest English author. Brexit was announced on 24th June, 2016. Eric Arthur Blair was born on 25th June, 1903. Eric did not use his original name for writing. His Pen name was George Orwell.</p>
        <p>In 1941, he had famously written in one of his works called ‘The Lion &amp; the Unicorn’ – Socialism &amp; The English Genius,</p>
        <p><i>“England resembles a family, a rather stuffy Victorian family, with not many black sheep in it but with all its cupboards bursting with skeletons. It has rich relations who have to be kowtowed to and poor relations who are horribly sat upon, and there is a deep conspiracy of silence about the source of the family income. It is a family in which the young are generally thwarted and most of the power is in the hands of irresponsible uncles and bedridden aunts. A family with the wrong members in control – that, perhaps, is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase.”</i></p>
        <p>32 years later England joined the EU.</p>
        <p>Orwell’s thoughts, through his works, truly make one think of the greater good, a good which otherwise the rest are blind to. His works always instill a feeling to contribute to the society. Of course the feeling dies slowly with one’s own life blindfolding them. But, between the birth &amp; death of this need for greater good, they, unknowingly or knowingly, contribute a little.</p>

        <h4>Down and Out in Paris and London</h4>
        <p>This unusual fictional account, in good part autobiographical, narrates without self-pity and often with humor the adventures of a penniless British writer among the down-and-out of two great cities. In the tales of both cities we learn some sobering Orwellian truths about poverty and society.</p>

        <h4>1984</h4>
        <p>Written in 1948, 1984 was George Orwell’s chilling prophecy about the future. And while 1984 has come and gone, Orwell’s narrative is timelier than ever. 1984 presents a startling and haunting vision of the world, so powerful that it is completely convincing from start to finish.</p>
